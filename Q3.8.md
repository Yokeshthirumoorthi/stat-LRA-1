3.8 The data in Table B.5 present the performance of a chemical process as a function of sever controllable process variables. 

**a.** Fit a multiple regression model relating C02 product (y) to total solvent (x6) and hydrogen consumption (x7). 
Here y = CO2 product
and x6 = total solvent,
x7 = hydrogen consumption,

$$\hat y = 2.526 + 0.0185x_6 + 2.1857x_7$$

**b.** Test for significance of regression. Calculate R2 and R2 adj.

    From model summary, it is observered that F-statistic: 27.95 with p-value 0.000 which is significant.

$$R^2 = 69.96\%$$
$$R^2_{adj} = 67.46\%$$


**c.** Using t tests determine the contribution of x6 and x7 to the model.

        		
| Coefficient | test statistic | p-value |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| B6          | 6.742          | 0.0000  |
| B7          | 2.247          | 0.0341  |

From t-statistic, it is observered that both total solvent(x6) and hydrogen consumption(x7) are significant for the model.

**d.** Construct 95% Cis on B6 and B7.
$$CI_{95\%}  \beta_6 = (0.013, 0.024)$$
$$CI_{95\%}  \beta_7 = (0.18, 4.19)$$

**e.** Refit the model using only x6 as the regressor. Test for significance of regression and calculate R2 and R2adj. Discuss your findings. Based on these statistics, are you satisfied with this model?
For the new model,
$$\hat y = 6.144 + 0.0195x_6$$

with t-statistic for beta-6 = 6.616 with p-value 0.000. Hence the regression is still significant. 

$$R^2 = 63.65\%$$
$$R^2_{adj} = 62.19\%$$

Also, the r-squared and r-squared adjusted are almost similar to previous model

**f.** Construct a 95 % CI on beta-6 using the model you fit in part e. Compare the length of this CI to the length of the CI in part d. Does this tell you anything important about the contribution of x7 to the model?

$$CI_{95\%}  \beta_6 = (0.013, 0.025)$$ 

The 95% CI is same for both models. Its shows that x7 has little or no effect on regression.

**g.** Compare the values of MSRes obtained for the two models you have fit (parts a and e ). How did the MSRes change when you removed x7 from the model? Does this tell you anything importaut about the contributiou of x7 to the model?

$$MS_{Res} \text{for Model1}= 98$$ 
$$MS_{Res} \text{for model2} = 114$$

When both x6 and x7 are included, we get lesser MSR
