**a.** Fit a multiple regression model relating concentration of NbOCl3 (y) to concentration of COCl2, (x1) and mole fraction (x4).

Here y = concentration of NbOCl3
and x1 = concentration of COCl2,
x4 = mole fraction,

$$\hat y = 0.0048 - 0.3449x_1 -0.0001x_4$$

**b.** Test for significance of regression.
    From model summary, it is observered that F-statistic: 24.66 with p-value 0.000 which is significant.

**c.** Calculate R2 and R2adj for this model.
$$R^2 = 66.36\%$$
$$R^2_{adj} = 63.67\%$$

**d.** Using t tests, determine the contribution of x1 and x4 to the model. Are both regressors x1 and x4 necessary?

| Coefficient | test statistic | p-value |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| B1          | -5.119         | 0.0000  |
| B4          | -0.018         | 0.986   |

From t-statistic, it is observered that concentration of COCl2(x1) is significant while mole fraction(x4) is not significant for the model.

**e.** Is multicollinearity a potential concern in this model? 

Since VIF is only 1.89, multicollinearity is not a concern for this model.
