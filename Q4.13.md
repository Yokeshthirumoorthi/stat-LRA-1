## Model 1 : Diagnostic plots of the linear regression fit

- Plot 1:
  
<p align="left">
  <img src="./Q4_13_residual_model1.png" width="450" title="hover text">
</p>

 - **Residuals vs Fitted:**
The plots are relatively shapeless and there is no linear pattern.

 - **Normal Q-Q:**
There does not seem to be a problem with normality as the plots are generally in a straight line.

 - **Scale-Location (or Spread-Location):** 
Since the variance of the residuals is not equally spread points the model has no homoscedasticity and has a heteroscedasticity problem.

- Plot 2:

<p align="left">
  <img src="./Q4_13_hist_model1.png" width="450" title="hover text">
</p>

The residual errors of this model are normally distributed.

## Model 2 : Diagnostic plots of the linear regression fit

- Plot 1:
  
<p align="left">
  <img src="./Q4_13_residual_model2.png" width="450" title="hover text">
</p>

 - **Residuals vs Fitted:**
The plot of residuals versus fitted values indicates a non-linear relationship in the data.

 - **Normal Q-Q:**
This model has its residuals normally distributed.

- **Scale-Location (or Spread-Location):** 
Since the variance of the residuals is not equally spread points the model no homoscedasticity and has a heteroscedasticity problem.

- Plot 2:

<p align="left">
  <img src="./Q4_13_hist_model2.png" width="450" title="hover text">

The residual errors of this model are normally distributed.

## Insight regarding the best choice of model

When model has both x6 and x7
$$PRESS = 3388.6$$
$$R^2_{pred}=56.94\%$$

When model has only x6
$$PRESS = 3692.9$$
$$R^2_{pred}=53.08\%$$

The residual plots for both models show nonconstant variance and departure from normality. Hence there is no insight into the best choice of model.
