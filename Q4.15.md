**a.** Construct a normal probability plot of the residuals. Does there seem to be any problem with the normality assumption?

There does not seem to be a problem with normality as the plots are generally in a straight line.

**b.** Construct and interpret a plot of the residuals versus the predicted response.

The plots are relatively shapeless and there is no linear pattern. The residuals are almost equally distributed around the 0 line without particularly large outliers.


**c.**  Construct the partial regression plots for this model. Does it seem that some variables currently in the model are not necessary?

x1 shows a linear pattern but x4 does not. Hence concentration of COCl2 has strongest influence on predicting the concentration of NbOCl3 when compared to mole fraction.
