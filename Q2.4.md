**a.**  Fit a simple linear regression model relating gasoline mileage y (miles per
gallon) to engine displacement x 1 (cubic inches). 

$$
    \hat y = 33.7 − .047x1
$$
  
**b.**  Construct the analysis-of-variance tahle and test for significance of regression.

        |            | d.f. | SS     | MS    |
        | ---------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
        | Regression | 1    | 955.7  | 955.7 |
        | Error      | 30   | 281.8  | 9.4   |
        | Total      | 31   | 1237.5 |


**c.**  What percent of the total variability in gasoline mileage is accounted for by the linear relationship with engine displacement?

$$
    R^2 = 77.23\%
$$

**d.**  Find a 95% CI on the mean gasoline mileage if the engine displacement is 275 in.3

$$
    (19.59, 21.81)
$$

**e.**  Suppose that we wish to predict the gasoline mileage obtained from a car with a 275-in.3 engine. Give a point estimate of mileage. Find a 95% prediction interval on the mileage.

$$
    (14.34, 27.06)
$$

**f.**  Compare the two intervals obtained in parts d and e. Explain the difference between them. Which one is wider, and why?   

PI is wider than CI on the mean, as it accounts for residual variance. In other words, it depends on the error from the fitted model and the future observation.

```
variance_of_PI = variance_of_CI + variance_of_residual
```
